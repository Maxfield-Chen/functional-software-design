# Part 1: Understanding the Domain

Building a shared mental model between domain experts and developers is the key.

## Focus on business events and workflows instead of datastructures
Domain events are prompts that cause a business to begin a transformation of data. This transformation of data is a primary mechanism for businesses to delivery value, important to model.

Domain events are *always written in past tense*, since they are something that has already happened. (eg. "A new order was received.")

### Event Storming
A mechanism for discovering domain events in a particular context.

A collaborative process bringing together anyone invested in the project. During the workshop:

* Everyone creates notes detailing business events
* The events are organized into a timeline
* Group uses timeline to logically find any missing events
* Questions without a clear answer are logged and discussed
* Generate a shared language
* Developer gets awareness of all teams involved

Discussion that happens here is non-technical and high-level.

## Partition the problem domain into small subdomains

## Create a model of each subdomain in the solution

## Develop a common language that is used everywhere by everyone
